# Face-Recognition
- In this first using Haar Cascade Classifiers we will detect face of a person and then analyze the face to extract data of the face and store it in the form of
numpy arrays and then predict the name of the person later.

## Introduction
- I used OpenCV, an open source library for computer vision, written in C/C++, that has interfaces in C++, Python and Java. It supports Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android. I also used a basice Machine learning algorithm called Naive bauyes classification.
